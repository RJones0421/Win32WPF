# Win32WPF
 For my Mercy engine, I plan on using WPF as the interface for the editor and other tools associated with the project.
 With my engine being written in C++ while WPF is written in C#/XML, I want to practice calling my code from across this language barrier as well as creating a view that I can render too.
 This project was thus created so I can experiment with this in a clean environment without having to worry about any complications that would come with the code I have already started.
